<h1 style="color: #DA0808;">Model & Implementation</h1>

<p>For our implementation, we used a python implementation of a kripke model found at https://github.com/erohkohl/mlsolver.</p>

<h2 id="game-erepresentation">Formal game and player representation </h2>
<p>The game of mafia consists of m players \(p \in P\). These players have exactly one role. The knowledge of these players is represented in a Kripke model \(M = \langle S, \pi, R_1, ..., R_m\rangle\).</p>
<p>The Kripke model contains a world \(s \in S\) for every possible combination of roles. A player can access a world (formalization needed) if and only if it considers the roles of all players in that world to be possible. Since players know their own roles, they therefore cannot access any world where they do not have those roles. It is also common knowledge which players are alive or dead. This is a part of the Kripke model in a formal description of the game.</p>
{Formal explanation of public announcements}
<p>During the game, certain public announcements are made. These can be the killing of a player, a vote by a player during the day phase, or an announcement of the role and knowledge of an informant or doctor.</p>
<h2 id="kripke-model">Our implementation of the Kripke Model</h2>
<p>Our implementation of the Kripke model contains worlds that assign truth values to variables such as "player 1 is a doctor" or "player 3 is in the mafia". To represent these worlds compactly, each world is given a name based on the variables which are true in that world. For example: in a world where player 1 is a villager, player 2 is a mafioso and player 3 is a doctor, the name of the world would be "VMD".</p>
<p>We chose not to include life or death in the worlds of our implementation of the Kripke model. Since whether a player is alive or dead is always common knowledge, as any death is publically announced, the question of "does player x know that player y is alive?" can always be answered by looking at the actual world of that player. Adding this to the worlds would increase their amount by a factor of \(2^m\) and would therefore drastically reduce the amount of players our model could handle.</p>

<h2 id="rules-information">Rules for gaining knowledge</h2>
<p>Players can gain knowledge by eliminating their access to certain worlds as a result of one of the public announcements mentioned above, role specific knowledge, or previous voting behavior. All players generate a list of roles that each player might have, based on the players' roles in the worlds the player can access. If they can only access worlds where a player has a certain role, they know the role of that player.</p>
<h3 id="announcement-knowledge">Knowledge through a public announcement</h3>
<p>The first type of public announcement is the death of a player. When this happens, their death is announced to all players, along with the role of the player who died. The players who are still alive eliminate any accessibility relations to worlds where the deceased player does not have that role.</p>
<p>The second type of public announcement is a vote during the day phase. While these announcements have no direct impact on the Kripke model, our implementation does keep track of which players have voted to eliminate which mafioso.</p>
<p>The third type of public announcement is an announcement by an informant or doctor of their special knowledge. In doing so, they reveal their own identity. The informant announces the identity of their targeted mafioso, while the doctor announces the patients they have saved, which cannot be members of the mafia. All players then eliminate accessibility relations to worlds where the informant's target is not a mafioso, or the doctor's patients are mafiosi.
<h3 id="role-knowledge">Role specific knowledge</h3>
<p>Informants get to know the role of one mafia member at the start of the game, by eliminating all accessibility relations to any world where their target is not a mafioso.</p>
<p>From the start of the game, members of the mafia are aware of who other members are, and doctors are aware of who the other doctors are. They eliminate any accessibility relations from worlds where a player is in their group, to a world where that player is not in their group.</p>
<p>During the game, doctors can learn that they managed to protect their target from elimination by the mafia. From this, they conclude that the person they saved cannot be in the mafia, so they eliminate any accessibility relations to worlds where that player is a mafioso.</p>
<h3 id="vote-knowledge">Knowledge from previous votes</h3>
<p>Our implementation stores the players that voted on each mafioso. When a mafioso is revealed, this means that all players now know that people who voted against that mafioso are not mafiosi themselves. Therefore they remove any accessibility relations to worlds where those people are mafiosi.</p>
