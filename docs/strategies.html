<h1 style="color: #DA0808;">The Strategies</h1>

<p>In the page <a href="./game.html"><font style="color: #E52222">Rules of the Game</font></a>, we present and explain the flow of the game, the different phases, and how players interact with each other. However, we never specify how they make decisions and update their knowledge. For our model and experiments, we consider various strategies that can be used across the different roles and phases for voting and eliminating players as well as revealing roles via public announcements. These strategies might influence how quickly players can uncover the identities of the opposing team members and eventually secure a victory in the game. The various strategies can be grouped into the following main categories:</p>


  <ul>
      <li><p><font style="color: #781515"><a href="#night_phase">Voting against innocent Villagers (Night phase)</a></font></p></li>
      <li><p><font style="color: #781515"><a href="#day_phase">Voting against Mafia members (Day phase)</a></font></p></li>
      <li><p><font style="color: #781515"><a href="#doctors_phase">Doctors protecting an innocent</a></font></p></li>
      <li><p><font style="color: #781515"><a href="#doctors_ann">Doctors revealing protected Villagers</a></font></p></li>
      <li><p><font style="color: #781515"><a href="#inf_ann">Informants revealing Mafia member</a></font></p></li>
    </ul>


<h2><a id="night_phase">Voting against innocent Villagers (Night phase) </a></h2>

<p>Initially, we explore the strategies employed by the Mafiosi during the night phase. These strategies are designed to identify the "highest value" innocent Villager that should be killed by the Mafia members.</p>

  <ul>
      <li><p><b>RANDOM:</b> Randomly select one of the alive players that is not part of the Mafia to kill.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>ENEMY:</b> Kill one of the alive players that is not part of the Mafia and on the previous day phase voted against one of the Mafiosi. By doing so, the Mafia aims to first eliminate players who harbor suspicion and pose a threat to their members.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>ALLIED:</b> Kill one of the alive players that is not part of the Mafia and on the previous day phase unintentionally supported Mafia by voting against other innocent players. This tactic may allow Mafia to potentially mislead the voting decisions of the Villagers during the day phase by removing players who, despite not suspecting the Mafia, are genuinely innocent. </p></li>
   </ul>

<p>The three aforementioned strategies are simple, straightforward, and not dynamic. Whichever strategy the Mafia selects at the beginning of the game will persist until the very end, without any alterations or adjustments. However, as it is also mentioned in the page <a href="./game.html"><font style="color: #E52222">Rules of the Game</font></a>, it is of paramount importance for increasing  the Mafiosi's chances of winning to eliminate characters with special abilities. Therefore, in addition to the predefined fixed strategies, we always prioritize the elimination of these special roles, namely the Doctors and the Informant. If, at any point, a player with a special role reveals their identity to all other players, they instantly become the primary target for elimination in the following night phase. The same holds when the identity of an ordinary Villager is revealed but with a lower priority compared to the Doctors who also possess the ability to save players and counteract the actions of the Mafiosi. This is because a player who is known to be an innocent, even a simple one, will never be targeted by the rest of the Villagers, and thus can not assist in the survival of the Mafia members. </p>

<h2><a id="day_phase">Voting against Mafia members (Day phase)</a></h2>

<p>Here, we present how the open voting process takes place during the day phase with the aim of eliminating Mafia members. In our model, each player randomly selects another player whom they suspect to be a Mafioso and casts their vote against them. Subsequently, we gather the votes from all players simultaneously and remove the player with the majority of downvotes from the game. The true identity of the eliminated player is then revealed. In case this player was a Mafioso, instantly the players who voted against him/her are shown to be innocent. An extension to this would be to also consider the past votes of the players killed during the previous night phases and use this information to determine the most likely suspect in the current day phase. That is because there is a high possibility that the votes of those players resulted in their own elimination and thus, would expose the true Mafia members. </p>

<h2><a id="doctors_phase">Doctors protecting an innocent</a></h2>

<p> In each cycle, the Doctors randomly select one of the alive players, including themselves, whom they believe to be innocent and provide them with protection against the Mafia's lethal actions during the respective night phase. All Doctors participating in the game always agree to save the same player. Upon successfully saving an innocent player, the Doctors' knowledge is updated by eliminating the possibility of that player being a Mafioso.</p>

<h2><a id="doctors_ann">Doctors revealing protected Villagers</a></h2>

<p>Protecting and revealing innocent players are two different actions. The former was discussed in the previous paragraph. Revealing protected Villagers means that one of the Doctors makes a public announcement and reveals the identities of the players that have been saved from the night phase so far. Players targeted by the mafia for elimination are only innocents and in this way, ordinary villagers increase their knowledge of their allies. There are two main strategies that Doctors can adopt for making these public announcements.</p>

  <ul>
      <li><p><b>DETERMINISTIC:</b> The Doctor is making a public announcement as soon as a certain predefined number of protected players has been reached. In simple words, if we set the number of protected players to two, <em>num_protectedPlayers=2</em>, once the Doctors have successfully saved two innocent Villagers, they will make an immediate public announcement, revealing the identities of the protected players. It is important to note that the protected players are the ones targeted for elimination by the Mafiosi during the night phase but were successfully protected by the Doctors.  </p></li>
      <li><p><b>RANDOM:</b> The Doctor makes a public announcement with a certain probability. To do so, they must have successfully saved at least one Villager and then, in each round, a check is made to see if the protected players' identity will be revealed. </p></li>
     
   </ul>
   
<p>In addition to the fundamental strategies, the Doctor must consider certain additional conditions before proceeding with a public announcement. This is because, in order to make an announcement, they must also disclose their own identity and role, making themselves the next target for the Mafiosi. Therefore, their revelation should always be valuable enough to justify the risk. Prior to announcing a player, the Doctor always checks if the role of that player is already known to all players. They proceed with the announcement only if the role is not already common knowledge, as it is only then that the announcement holds sufficient value. </p>

<p>The second condition pertains to the specific Doctor who will make the announcement. While multiple Doctors may be involved in protecting players, only one of them is required to disclose their secret role. To determine which Doctor will fulfill this role, we examine whether any Doctor is included in the list of protected players. Recall that Mafiosi have the ability to target Doctors during the night phase, and Doctors can also choose to protect themselves. If a Doctor is among the protected players, they will be the one to make the announcement. This choice is made to prevent the revelation of two Doctors, ensuring that only one Doctor's role is exposed, while the others remain hidden. </p>

<h2><a id="inf_ann">Informants revealing Mafia member</a></h2>

<p>As outlined in the <a href="./game.html"><font style="color: #E52222">Rules of the Game</font></a> page, the Informant is another civilian role with the unique ability of knowing from the beginning of the game the identity of one Mafioso. Similar to the Doctors, the Informant can choose between the same two strategies, namely <b> DETERMINISTIC </b> and <b> RANDOM </b>, in order to make a public announcement and reveal their identity. This role has the same risk of becoming the next target of Mafiosi after the revelation. </p>

<p> These two strategies hold throughout the entire game, with only one exception: when only one Mafioso remains alive, and is the one the Informant knows their identity. In this particular scenario, the Informant will reveal the Mafioso's identity and this will be the last elimination that will also give the victory to the Villagers!</p>


<p> Please note that all the strategies mentioned above are applicable as long as the corresponding roles are still in the game. Every time a player is killed the knowledge (gained and hidden) as well as the strategies are adapted accordingly. </p>
