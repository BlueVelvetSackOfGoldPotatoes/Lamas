<h1 style="color: #DA0808;">Simplifications</h1>

<p>To facilitate modeling and analysis, we have streamlined the official full version of the Mafia game. Our approach involves making necessary modifications to the fundamental roles and rules of the game, ensuring a more conducive framework for study and analysis. </p>

<p> <b>1.</b> To begin with, while in the official game, players are allowed to lie about their identities and knowledge, in our model we make the assumption that players do not engage in any kind of deception. When players reveal their identity and share their knowledge, it is taken as truthful information by the other participants. This modification allows for a more transparent and reliable gameplay experience within our model. </p>

<p> <b>2.</b> During the day phase, the ultimate step of the voting process occurs simultaneously for all players, without any interaction or guidance from certain individuals to others. Each player independently participates in the voting process, making their own decisions without external influence. This approach eliminates dynamic voting that may be influenced by specific members' choices and also avoids the exponential number of cases and voting patterns that could arise in our experiments. By streamlining the voting process, we ensure a more manageable and focused analysis of the game dynamics. </p>

<p> <b>3.</b> Whenever a person is removed from the game, its identity (role) is always revealed. </p>


<p> <b>4.</b> We also make the assumption that Mafia members never vote against other Mafia members. Therefore, when a player votes to eliminate a Mafioso, it becomes evident that this player is innocent. This information becomes crucial when a genuine Mafioso is eliminated during the day phase. In such instances, it becomes common knowledge among all players that anyone who voted against the Mafioso is a Villager. This assumption enhances the overall knowledge of the players and significantly contributes to the advancement of the game. </p>

<p> <b>5.</b> Throughout the game, we operate under the assumption that players possess excellent memory and can recall all the votes given by each player. This means that even a vote cast in the early stages of the game can have a lasting impact on the game's progression in later stages. By considering the full history of votes, players can analyze patterns, track voting behaviors, and make informed decisions based on the accumulated information. For instance, let's consider a scenario where <em>Player 1</em> voted against <em>Mafioso A</em> during the first round. If <em>Mafioso A</em> is eventually eliminated or its identity is revealed in the fifth round of the game, it will then become evident to all players that <em>Player 1</em> is a Villager, as per the simplification described in Rule 4. This assumption emphasizes the importance of past votes and encourages strategic thinking and careful observation throughout the game.  </p>

<p> <b>6.</b> Multiple Doctor players can participate in the game, and similar to the Mafia members, Doctors are aware of each other's identities from the beginning of the game. During the night phase, they collaborate and decide together on the player they are going to protect.</p>
